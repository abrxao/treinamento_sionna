To run the software, execute the following script:

```
/usr/share/sumo/tools/osmWebWizard.py
```

You can run it using Python 3:

```
python3 osmWebWizard.py
```

After executing the above command, the software may open the index.html file in an incorrect path on your machine. In case this happens, you can access the correct path:

```
/usr/share/sumo/tools/webWizard/index.html
```

Once you have opened the index.html file and selected your desired simulation area, proceed to click on "Generate Traffic." This action will redirect you to the SUMO-GUI window displaying the simulation.

In the SUMO-GUI window, you can adjust the delay settings and start the simulation. If it's your first time using the software, it's recommended to set the delay to 200 milliseconds for smoother simulation playback.
